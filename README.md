# nawdex-hackathon

A collection of analysis scripts for ICON simulations for the NAWDEX field campaign. This is currently a bit of a random archive but will be filled and curated as the analysis evolves.

The directory structure is as follows:

* bashscripts: scripts to pull data from the DKRZ archive
* ccfsampling: calulation of cloud controlling factor sampling
* means: calculation of mean quantities, where mean can be over time and/or space
* postprocessing: scripts and notebooks to calculate postprocessed data, such as ocean masks, re-diagnosed radiaive heating rates, CRE from CERES, ...
* sandbox: a playground of scripts that were written but not polished, yet still might be useful to keep
* shared: a collection of utility dictionaries and functions, e.g., the simulation dictionary and a function to drop the first day of a dataset
